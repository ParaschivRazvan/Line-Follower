# Line-Follower
My very first line follower

This is an infrared sensors based line follower robot which uses 6 analogic IR sensors to guide itself along a black line. The robot  has been built by using a 3D printed model, an Arduino Genuino/Uno board, a breadboard, 2 DC motors and a ball caster. In terms of electronical components I have used and L293D driver, a L7805D voltage stabilizer, 2 push-buttons, one switch, 2 capacitors and 4 AA batteries. In terms of coding, besides the basic line follower implementation : motor speed, calibration and the weighted average of the sensors scaling; I have tried to implement a PID controller. At its current state the line follower uses a PD controller.
